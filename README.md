## Getting Started

Hello, everyoneðŸ«‚! A very very Happy New Year to everyoneðŸŽ‡ðŸŽŠ !

So I've decided to take the #6companies30days challenge which is being conducted by Arsh Goyal.

I am very thankful to Arsh Goyal sir for providing us with this wonderful challenge where we will not only get to know about the level of questions of the 'Dream Companies' but will also build a habit of coding.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
